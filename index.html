	    <p><b>Abstract:</b> We present a sensing system that
	      determines soil moisture via RF using backscatter tags
	      paired with a commodity ultra-wideband RF
	      transceiver. Despite decades of research confirming the
	      benefits, soil moisture sensors are still not widely
	      adopted on working farms for three key reasons: the high
	      cost of sensors, the difficulty of deploying and
	      maintaining these sensors, and the lack of reliable
	      internet access in rural areas. We seek to address these
	      obstacles by designing a low-cost soil moisture sensing
	      system that uses a hybrid approach of pairing completely
	      wireless backscatter tags with a mobile reader. We
	      designed and built two backscatter tag prototypes and
	      tested our system both in laboratory and in situ at an
	      organic farm field. Our backscatter tags have a
	      projected battery lifetime of up to 15 years on 4xAA
	      batteries, and can operate at a depth of at least 30cm
	      and up to 75cm. We achieve an average accuracy within
	      1-3% of the ground truth with a 90th percentile of 3.4%,
	      which is comparable to state-of-the-art commercial soil
	      sensors, at an order of magnitude lower cost.
