		       Our short paper titled Farming Electrons:
		       Galvanic vs. Microbial Energy in Soil Batteries
		       has been accepted to IEEE Sensors Letters.
		     </p>
		     <p>
		       Abstract: Recent work shows the exciting
		       potential for soil microbes as a renewable
		       energy harvesting source. However, the choice
		       of materials in microbial fuel cells (MFCs)
		       significantly impacts where the energy comes
		       from. MFCs with metallic anodes draw energy
		       from both renewable bacterial activity and
		       non-renewable galvanic corrosion of cell
		       components. Previous studies do not analyze
		       these two power sources separately. This letter
		       clarifies the behavior of metallic MFCs by
		       characterizing galvanic activity separately
		       from biological activity. We find that the
		       majority of energy attained from prior designs
		       is most likely galvanic, not bacterial, and as
		       a consequence is non-renewable.

			     Our work on low-cost, high accuracy
			     in-situ soil moisture sensing has been
			     accepted for publication at ACM COMPASS
			     2021. The paper is titled Low-cost
			     In-ground Soil Moisture Sensing with
			     Radar Backscatter Tags. ACM COMPASS aims
			     to be the forum for the presentation and
			     publication of original research from a
			     broad array of disciplines, including
			     computer and information sciences, social
			     sciences, environmental sciences and
			     engineering, that support the growth of
			     sustainable societies worldwide.

			     Abstract: Despite decades of research
			     confirming the benefits, most farms do
			     not incorporate soil moisture sensing
			     into their irrigation practices. Soil
			     moisture sensing can be broken into two
			     broad approaches, both of which have
			     drawbacks. In situ sensors are installed
			     in the ground, tend to be difficult to
			     deploy and maintain, and have high
			     costs. Remote-sensing based approaches
			     use radars to infer soil moisture from
			     surface reflection properties. While
			     completely wireless, remote sensing
			     suffers from lower resolution and
			     accuracy compared to in situ sensing.
			   </P>
			   <p>
			     We propose a hybrid approach that
			     combines the advantages of both. This
			     paper introduces the idea of using
			     inexpensive in situ backscatter tags with
			     above-ground radars, which enables
			     completely wireless soil moisture
			     measurements at low cost and with
			     high-accuracy and high-resolution. Our
			     key idea is introducing a simple, power
			     efficient modulation scheme that enables
			     commodity radars to easily detect and
			     range the underground tag. We have
			     benchmarked our approach against
			     oven-based ground-truth measurements and
			     demonstrated that, at a realistic depth
			     and across several types of soil, we
			     achieve a 90th percentile error of 4%,
			     which is the same accuracy as
			     state-of-the-art in situ sensors. We also
			     demonstrate that our approach works with
			     similar accuracy at a real farm.

			     Agricultural soil moisture measurement is
                              usually done with extensive in situ
                              sensor deployments. These sensor
                              networks are often difficult to install
                              and maintain. Ground penetrating radars
                              have also been used to do fine-grained
                              moisture measurements in farm fields,
                              but usually require the radar to be in
                              or near contact with the soil. In this
                              paper we propose a hybrid approach that
                              combines an in situ backscatter
                              reflector with an ultra-wideband radar
                              that is small enough to be handheld or
                              mounted to a drone. The underground
                              backscatter reflector allows for
                              accurate time-of-flight
                              measurements. The time-of-flight is
                              determined by the permittivity of the
                              soil, which is influenced primarily by
                              the soil water content for non-saline
                              soils. We performed both laboratory and
                              in situ measurements, achieving an
                              average accuracy within 0.013 cm3/cm3 of
                              the ground truth with a 90th percentile
                              of 0.034 cm3/cm3. This demonstrates the
                              feasibility of our approach.

			     We introduce the design and
			     implementation of BackCam, a low-power
			     wireless camera sensor platform that
			     supports continuous realtime vision
			     applications, all using commodity
			     radios. In the lowest power mode, our
			     camera board consumes only 9.7mW and
			     continuously transmits images for over
			     one month on two AA batteries. We
			     introduce a novel power management system
			     that incorporates input from the camera
			     itself to increase battery life up to
			     62%. Using images and system metadata as
			     input, we designed a feedback system
			     between the sensor and the gateway. This
			     allows dynamic vision application
			     requirements to be met while consuming as
			     little power as possible. For example,
			     our system can temporarily increase the
			     resolution after an object of interest is
			     detected, then reduce it again after it
			     has disappeared. This increases the
			     accuracy of simplistic facial recognition
			     by at least 25% compared to operating
			     constantly in the lowest power mode. We
			     implement communications using a
			     full-duplex WiFi backscatter radio,
			     ensuring compatibility with commodity
			     WiFi devices. We also designed an
			     efficient data streaming and compression
			     pipeline straight from the camera to the
			     backscatter transmitter, allowing us to
			     minimize latency and avoid expensive
			     memory writes. We deployed BackCam in a
			     real office environment, and as a
			     proof-of-concept, implemented basic
			     realtime face detection and recognition.

                           <p>
At the CoNEXT 2017 conference in Seoul, South Korea, we introduced the design and implementation of FreeRider, the first system to enable backscatter communication with multiple commodity radios, such as 802.11g/n WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth, while these radios are simultaneously used for productive data communication. Furthermore, we are, to our knowledge, the first to implement and evaluate a multi-tag system.
                           </p>
			   <p>
			     The key technique used by FreeRider is codeword translation, where a tag can transform a codeword present in the original excitation signal into another valid codeword from the same codebook during backscattering. In other words, the backscattered signal is still a valid WiFi, ZigBee, or Bluetooth signal. Therefore, commodity radios decode the backscattered signal and extract the tag’s embedded information. More importantly, FreeRider does codeword translation regardless of the data transmitted by these radios. Therefore, these radios can still do productive data communication. FreeRider accomplishes codeword translation by modifying one or more of the three dimensions of a wireless signal — amplitude, phase and frequency. A tag ensures that the modified signal is still comprised of valid codewords that come the same codebook as the original excitation signal. We built a hardware prototype of FreeRider, and our empirical evaluations show a data rate of ∼60kbps in single tag mode, 15kbps in multi-tag mode, and a backscatter communication distance up to 42m when operating on 802.11g/n WiFi.
